# Queues (FIFO)

A list with a restriction that insertion can be performed only from one end, called the rear and deletion can be performed at the other end, called the front.

1. Enqueue / Push -

   This is basically insertion

2. Dqueue/ Pop -

   This is removing the first item from the queue

3. Front/ Peek -

   Returns element at the front of the queue

4. isEmpty -

   Check if a queue if empty

5. isFull -

   Check if a queue if full

All of the operations in a queue take constant time,
or their big O notation is **O(n)**

> Queue is called a First In First Out (FIFO) structure

## Applications

- We have a shared resource but it can only take one request at a time
- Process Scheduling
