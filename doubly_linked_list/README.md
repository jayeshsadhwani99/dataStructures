# Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields and one data field.

It is just like a linked list or singly linked list, except it has a pointer for the previous node too.

## Advantages

- Reverse lookup

## Disadvantages

- Use extra memory for pointer at previous node
